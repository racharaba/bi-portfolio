## üìä Portfolio Projects

### **Project 1: Sales Performance Dashboard**

* **Problem:** A retail company needs to track and analyze its sales performance to identify top-performing products, regions, and sales reps.
* **Solution:** I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, profit margin, and sales by region. The dashboard allows users to filter data by date, product category, and employee.
* **Skills Used:** Power BI for dashboard design and DAX for custom calculations. SQL for data querying and cleaning.

### **Project 2: Customer Churn Analysis**

* **Problem:** A telecommunications company wants to understand why customers are churning and predict which customers are at risk.
* **Solution:** I used Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a visualization in Tableau to highlight key churn drivers, such as contract type, monthly charges, and service usage.
* **Skills Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data cleaning and EDA. Tableau for advanced visualization and storyboarding.

### **Project 3: E-commerce Funnel Analysis**

* **Problem:** An e-commerce business needs to optimize its customer conversion funnel by identifying drop-off points.
* **Solution:** I created a funnel chart and a series of other visualizations to track user flow from website visit to purchase, providing insights on where to focus marketing and user experience efforts.
* **Skills Used:** SQL for data extraction and transformation. Google Data Studio for dashboard creation and collaboration.
